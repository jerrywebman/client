            The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic
            transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial
            transactions but virtually everything of value. A network of
            computing nodes makes up the ‘Blockchain’, computer connected to the
            blockchain network using a client that performs the task of
            validating and relaying transactions. gets a copy of the blockchain,
            which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the blockchain
            network. Together they create a powerful second-level network, a
            wholly different vision for how the internet can function. Every
            node is an “administrator” of the blockchain, and joins the network
            voluntarily (in this sense, the network is decentralized).

            Blockchain is a decentralized technology meaning anything that
            happens on it is a function of the network as a whole. Some
            important implications stem from this. By creating a new way to
            verify transactions aspects of traditional commerce could become
            unnecessary. Stock market trades become almost simultaneous on the
            blockchain, for instance — or it could make types of record keeping,
            like a land registry, fully public. And decentralization is already
            a reality. A global network of computers uses blockchain technology
            to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions.
            That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any central
            authority. Decentralization means the network operates on a
            user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis.

            Bitcoins and all alt coins(Etherum, Ripple, Sudan Gold Coin ...) are
            cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency
            that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to
            counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized
            networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger
            enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
            cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any
            central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government
            interference or manipulation.

            Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency, which is used and distributed
            electronically. Bitcoin is simply called a decentralised
            peer-to-peer network. No single institution or person controls it.
            Bitcoin connects buyers and sellers through encryption keys. And it
            isn't issued from the top down like traditional currency; rather,
            bitcoin is "mined" by powerful computers connected to the internet.
            Bitcoins has a fixed limited supply of just 21 million bitcoin ever,
            so unlike paper currency no more can be printed. Bitcoin was first
            introduced as an open-source software by an anonymous programmer, or
            a group of programmers, under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.
            There has been a lot of rumours about the real identity of who
            invented bitcoin.

            Ethereum is a decentralized platform for creation of new
            cryptocurrecies and decentralized application (DAPPS) . On the

            which coukld be accessible worldwide. In a nutshell, ethereum is an
            open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables
            developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DAPPS).
            Ethereum whitepaper was first published by vitalik buterin on
            November 2013. The original ethereum development team which
            consisted of vitalik buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio and
            Charlse Hoskinson announced publicly on January 2014 about the
            development of ethereum platform. Ethereum ends their ICO after they
            successfully raised $18.4 million on August 2014.

            an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency is sold to early
            believers of the project in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, but
            usually for Bitcoin or Ethereum. During the ICO campaign,

            An Initial Exchange Offering, commonly referred to as an IEO, is a
            fundraising event that is administered by an exchange. In contrast
            to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where the project team themselves
            conduct the fundraising, an Initial Exchange Offering means that the
            fundraising will be conducted on a well-known exchange’s fundraising
            platform, where users can purchase tokens with funds directly from
            their own exchange wallet. This event fixed almost all ICO flaws
            experienced in 2017 to be a very high-risk environment for
            individuals wanting to participate in new blockchain project token
            releases, from accidentally sending funds to the wrong wallet, or
            some project teams absconding with funds.
