  "intro": "UK National Cyber Security Centre Includes Cryptojacking In Report ",
  "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">On 10th April, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)&nbsp;released a report&nbsp;analyzing how nefarious cyber activity influenced the business environment in Great Britain over the past year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report dedicates a section to&nbsp;cryptojacking, a form of cyber attack in which a hacker utilizes an individual&rsquo;s computer, without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge, to mine&nbsp;cryptocurrencies. Often the only way to notice that a device is being cryptojacked is a slight slowdown in performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NCSC believes that, with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, methods of digital currencies mining via users&rsquo; CPU power, such as cryptojacking, will probably become a steady source of revenue for website owners and hackers . According to the report:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The technique of delivering cryptocurrency miners through malware has been used for several years, but it is likely in 2018-19 that one of the main threats will be a newer technique of mining cryptocurrency which exploits visitors to a website.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report states that incidences of cryptojacking increased in 2017. In December 2017, 55 percent of businesses worldwide were impacted by cryptocurrency miners. In February 2018, more than 4,000 websites globally (including about 600 in the UK) secretly mined&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/search?query=digital+currency\">digital currency</a>&nbsp;with compromised screen-reading plugins designed for blind and partially sighted people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NCSC believes that the majority of cryptojacking is performed by cyber criminals. However, website owners have also targeted visitors and utilized the CPU power of visitors&rsquo; computers to mine cryptocurrency to their own advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In past years, malware&nbsp;has proven itself to be an effective technique for mining cryptocurrencies through exploiting common users&rsquo; software vulnerabilities. Last month,&nbsp;Microsofts Windows Defender Antivirus&nbsp;blocked over 400,000&nbsp;attempts of malware to infect users with a cryptocurrency miner in a 12 hour span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January, the Opera web browser&nbsp;announced&nbsp;&nbsp;they would add anti-crypto mining to their mobile browser after including it in their integrated ad blocker for desktop.</p>\r\n",

  "intro": "Bitpay Confirms Bitcoincash As Retail Payments Cause For price Spike",
  "body": "<p>Cryptocurrency payment service provider BitPay has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-checkout/\">announced</a>&nbsp;that it will allow&nbsp;brick-and-mortar businesses to use Bitcoin Cash for payments. Already available for Bitcoin, the new service will give customers the option to choose between paying in bitcoin or bitcoincash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BitPay Checkout, used by restaurants and other retail businesses, is currently being used in Atlanta, Toronto,&nbsp;St. Petersburg, Madeira Beach and Paris. BitPay has been serving these entities since Nov. 2014, which is why the company has decided to include more options for crypto payments. With 1% processing fee and integration with companies such as Shopify,&nbsp;3DCart and&nbsp;Bitmonet, BCH users will find the new update favorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When customers go to pay, they can select their currency of choice, select the option to give a tip, then scan a BitPay Checkout QR code with their mobile wallets,&rdquo; BitPay wrote. &ldquo;Payments take just a swipe or a tap, and the receiving merchant gets a local currency bank settlement within one business day. Merchants get every dollar or euro they charge, minus BitPay&rsquo;s 1% processing fee.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/bitpay-merchants-can-now-accept-bitcoin-cash-payments/\">Last month</a>, BitPay upgraded their system so that buyers using the platform could accept online payments in Bitcoin Cash as well as Bitcoin. After joining the crypto community in 2011, this was the first time an altcoin was included by the company. The press release stated that merchants integrating BitPay for small-scale transactions including video games and app downloads would find it easier &ldquo;since Bitcoin Cash costs only pennies (or less) for customers to send&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year,&nbsp;BitPay co-founder,&nbsp;Stephen Pair, said that after careful observation, they found out that no bitcoin alternative was innovative or &ldquo;compelling&rdquo;. Despite scaling issues, Pair concluded that Bitcoin was the best cryptocurrency till date. However, following Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s launch in August, BitPay allowed users to store and spend BCH in its open source wallet,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/rally-ethereum-bitcoin-prices-lead-markets-20-billion-advance/\">Copay</a>. This announcement was considered as one of the reasons behind the increase in BCH&rsquo;s price from $313 to $431 within 24 hours in Sep. 2017. The next month, BitPay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bitpay.com/multiple-blockchains/\">confirmed</a>&nbsp;that it would begin accepting &ldquo;additional blockchain payment methods&rdquo; starting with BCH. Once again, the news caused BCH to break records by crossing the $2,000 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-cash-price-leaps-19-as-other-large-caps-flounder/\">Bitcoin Cash</a>, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, has once again increased by almost 19% after BitPay&rsquo;s announcement today. However, the price was already rising upwards &ndash; it is now up 100% in one week. The market cap has also doubled within these seven days, climbing from $12 billion to $24 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>https://i.imgur.com/DYVq4HH.png<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DYVq4HH.png\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DYVq4HH.png\" /></a><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DYVq4HH.png\" style=\"float:right; height:208px; width:400px\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DYVq4HH.png\" style=\"float:right; height:182px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

The amount of crypto alleged to be stolen is between $1.8-2 mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Superintendent Jagdish Patel was arrested in his official residence in Amreli two nights ago, and will be will be interrogated along with accused police inspector Anant Patel,&rdquo; according to a police officer, the Hindustan Times writes.

Bhatt named Kotadia as pressuring him to accept the ransom request.\r\n\r\nIn a larger case of theft in India, Indian crypto exchange Coinsecure reported the loss of around 485 BTC (around $4.4 mln at current BTC prices) due to alleged misconduct by an employee.</p>\r\n",

The Bitcoin Cash price rallied in recent weeks amid an upcoming hard fork that&rsquo;s scheduled for mid-May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee suggests that Bitcoin Cash is &ldquo;overbought&rdquo;, pointing to Kelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;new entry&rdquo; in Bitcoin Cash as helping to drive the price higher, though the BCH price has pulled back some from last week&rsquo;s rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bch.jpg\" title=\"'New Money' is on Bitcoin, Not Bitcoin Cash: Fundstrat's Tom Lee\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bch.jpg\" style=\"height:601px; width:788px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bitcoin Bottom</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Lee has been arguing that bitcoin has bottomed&nbsp;and recently tweeted that institutional interest &ldquo;is a leading indicator for flows of big money into crypto.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/988817606604881920/photo/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" title=\"View image on Twitter\">View image on Twitter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/988817606604881920/photo/1\"><img alt=\"View image on Twitter\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dbj8X0JW0AAiQAH?format=jpg&amp;name=small\" style=\"height:938px; width:1200px\" title=\"View image on Twitter\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fundstrat\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/510834353283145729/CtFjYadW_normal.jpeg\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fundstrat\">Thomas Lee@fundstrat</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CRYPTO: We hosted a small group of institutional investors on 4/23, mix of crypto and traditional macro HF/long-only.

He refuted the idea that in the wake of the market&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-sees-around-50-percent-losses-across-the-board-at-end-of-first-quarter-2018\">early year crash</a>, now could be an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-hitting-40-trln-in-10-years-definitely-possible-says-pantera-capital-ceo\">opportune moment</a>&nbsp;for investors to get in:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of people [are] asking [whether] now [is] the right time to buy, and the short answer is no, for two fundamental reasons. The first is we&rsquo;re not seeing a lot of incremental engagement from people interested in buying Bitcoin for the first time, and like any new technology you need new adopters to come in to make it more valuable. And in terms of Google searches, they are way down from the peaks back in December and January, [by] 85 to 90 percent&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Colas added that he was concerned that there is now relatively little wallet growth, with only 2.2 percent more people opening Bitcoin wallets to purchase the cryptocurrency last month, as opposed to the 5-7 percent monthly growth that was recorded during all of last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked whether last year&rsquo;s soaring market valuations were evidence that Bitcoin is indeed a bubble, Colas responded:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Certainly in retrospect it was absolutely a bubble based around the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-markets-really-like-cboe-futures-prices-spike-sharply\">Futures</a>&nbsp;launch in December &hellip; [I&rsquo;ve covered Bitcoin] since 2013, [I] fundamentally believe in the structure of the technology and the story, but it obviously has huge price volatility around it, and we&rsquo;ve seen that even in the past month with [the market] rallying as much as it has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Colas&rsquo;s circumspect tone as to whether mainstream adoption can become a reality anytime soon sets his argument apart from other crypto investment perspectives, which can often seem hopelessly polarized between either the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/buying-bitcoin-is-not-investing-claims-oracle-of-omaha-warren-buffett\">diehard skeptics</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-hedge-fund-pantera-capital-btc-will-highly-likely-break-20000-this-year\">exuberant</a>&nbsp;Bitcoin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-says-btc-will-hit-25000-in-2018-advises-aggressive-buying-at-market-low\">bulls</a></p>\r\n",

The transaction would have been accepted by Bitcoin-ABC 0.17.0 and mined into a block but rejected by all other bitcoin cash mining software &mdash; including previous versions of Bitcoin-ABC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ccn.com/tag/bitcoin-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>&nbsp;was made aware of the vulnerability on April 26, and developers quietly distributed a patch to mining pool operators and &ldquo;verified bitcoin cash miners&rdquo; before disclosing the potential exploit to the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the statement:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;After analysis of the vulnerability and possible responses, Bitcoin-ABC developers prepared a patch for the vulnerability, and a private release, to distribute directly to mining pool operators. Due to the decentralized nature of the mining community it was not possible to reach everyone directly. This release was provided to verified Bitcoin Cash miners to forward to trusted miners once they had upgraded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That patch has now received a general release, so miners using Bitcoin-ABC 0.17.0 are advised to upgrade to Bitcoin-ABC 0.17.1, which closes the attack vector.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin ABC will be taking several actions in order to prevent such an event from occurring again, as well as reduce the overall response time in the case of emergent issues in the future,&rdquo; the company promised in its statement. &ldquo;Additionally, Bitcoin ABC is in discussions with industry participants to establish a formal bug bounty system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, Bitcoin ABC said that they were alerted to the vulnerability by a &ldquo;clear and professional&rdquo; report from an anonymous tipster, to whom they intend to give a reward if he or she comes forward.</p>\r\n",

The campaign infected over 40,000 machines across various industries, including finance, education, and&nbsp;government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The campaign called Operation Prowli used various techniques like exploits and password brute-forcing to spread malware and take over devices, such as web servers, modems, and Internet-of-Things (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/internet-of-things\">IoT</a>) devices. GuardiCore found that the attackers behind Prowli were focused on making money rather than ideology or espionage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the report, the compromised devices were infected with a&nbsp;Monero&nbsp;(XMR) miner and the r2r2 worm, a&nbsp;malware&nbsp;that executes SSH brute-force attacks from the hacked devices, and backs the Prowli to affect new victims. In other words, by randomly generating IP address blocks, r2r2 tries to brute-force SSH logins with a user/ password dictionary, and after breaking in runs a series of commands on the victim. The GuardiCore wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The attacks all behaved in the same fashion, communicating with the same C&amp;C server to download a number of attack tools named r2r2 along with a cryptocurrency miner.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, cybercrooks used an open source webshell named &ldquo;WSO Web Shell&rdquo; to alter the compromised websites to host malicious code that redirects site visitors to a traffic distribution system, which then redirects them to various other malicious sites. Once redirected to a fake website, users fell victim to clicking on malicious browser extensions. The GuardiCore team reported that Prowli managed to compromise more than 9,000 companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, a new piece of&nbsp;cryptojacking<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-snobbish-cryptojacking-malware-infected-500k-users-in-3-days-report-says\"> </a>malware<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-snobbish-cryptojacking-malware-infected-500k-users-in-3-days-report-says\"> </a>used<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-snobbish-cryptojacking-malware-infected-500k-users-in-3-days-report-says\"> </a>half a million<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-snobbish-cryptojacking-malware-infected-500k-users-in-3-days-report-says\"> </a>computers&nbsp;to mine 133 Monero tokens in three days.

While the government maintains a&nbsp;hardline&nbsp;stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), the PBoC has been extensively investigating the benefits of harnessing their underlying technology for the existing financial system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Governor of the PBoC, Zhou Xiaochuan, has&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that digital currencies will ultimately diminish cash circulation and are &ldquo;technologically inevitable,&rdquo; while stressing the PBoC&rsquo;s role in controlling the &ldquo;unpredictable effects&rdquo; of certain applications of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, the director of PBoC&rsquo;s Digital Currency Research Lab, Yao Qian,&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;a likewise cautiously affirmative opinion piece for Chinese media advocating for many of blockchain&rsquo;s potential benefits, while arguing for the need to temper its decentralization in certain scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just this month, the PBoC has revealed a new blockchain-powered system with&nbsp;smart contractfunctionality designed to tokenize paper checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond PBoC, in 2017 China as a whole was reported to have&nbsp;filed&nbsp;more blockchain tech patents than any other country with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).People&rsquo;s Bank of China Files Patent for Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\r\n",

  "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Financial Director of Zug,&nbsp;Switzerland, Heinz T&auml;nnler called on the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to create a working group to help blockchain companies open&nbsp;bank&nbsp;accounts, local news outlet cash.ch&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cash.ch/news/top-news/digitalisierung-zuger-finanzdirektor-will-blockchain-firmen-zu-bankkonten-verhelfen-1185646\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>&nbsp;June 26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>blockchain&nbsp;and&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;companies&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp;faceing difficulties with opening bank accounts in the country, T&auml;nnler together with the Financial Director of Zurich Ernst Stocker brought the issue to the attention of Federal Council Ueli Maurer. T&auml;nnler is reportedly concerned about the risk of losing business to countries with more friendly banking conditions for blockchain companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>T&auml;nnler said that blockchain offers great potential for Switzerland, stating that &quot;it must not be that Switzerland loses an innovative industry because it makes payment transactions impossible.&quot; Maurer subsequently called a meeting with representatives of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), the State Secretariat for International Financial Affairs (SIF), the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the SBA, Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, and the cantons of Zurich and Zug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, a working group headed by the SBA has been established, which is charged to develop recommendations for banks on how to deal with local blockchain companies in order to open an account. The recommendations will also be consolidated with FINMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to cash.ch, the Tax Directorate of the Canton of Zug issued a statement saying that the reason for the lack of legal certainty from banks lies in the necessity of compliance with all financial market regulations, especially with&nbsp;money laundering. Per the statement, existing financial market regulations are not tailored to blockchain-based companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Hypothekarbank Lenzburg&nbsp;became the first bank&nbsp;in Switzerland to provide business accounts to blockchain and crypto companies. While&nbsp;Falcon Private Bank&nbsp;has provided crypto asset management services since last year, the bank&rsquo;s CEO confirmed that they are first in the country to open company accounts for blockchain and crypto companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In May, the decision of Polish banks not to cooperate with&nbsp;BitBay, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in&nbsp;Poland, forced the company to&nbsp;suspend its activities&nbsp;in the country. The exchange announced it would reopen with a new supplier in the jurisdiction of the Republic of&nbsp;Malta, where local laws are more lenient with crypto-business.</p>\r\n",

The authors say these factors, in addition to regulatory compliance, are necessary for the technology to be deployed in today&rsquo;s markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ray stressed that adoption of blockchain &ldquo;within core market infrastructure operations can take time.&rdquo; De Chazournes added that it can be &ldquo;extremely difficult&rdquo; for all stakeholders to develop a blockchain-powered project that would replace an existing system, particularly within an international exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last week, the CEO of Spanish bank BBVA&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;that blockchain technology is &ldquo;not mature&rdquo; and faces major problems, such as &ldquo;volatility of underlying currencies&rdquo; and possible compatibility issues with tax authorities and financial regulators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in May, First Deputy Governor of the Russian Central Bank Olga Skorobogatova&nbsp;similarly critiqued&nbsp;blockchain, claiming that the technology is not yet &ldquo;mature&rdquo; enough for industrial-scale use. &ldquo;Technology for the sake of technology is pointless,&rdquo; she stressed that the international community should first come up with a &ldquo;pragmatic understanding&rdquo; of blockchain&rsquo;s benefits.</p>\r\n",

Coinbase says it plans to continue adding support for more assets, as well as to open its service to Asian institutions, &ldquo;by the end of the year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company says that Coinbase Custody will employ a range of security measures, including &ldquo;on-chain segregation of crypto assets,&rdquo; &ldquo;offline, multi-sig and geographically distributed transaction protection&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;robust cold storage auditing and reporting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alongside cold storage, reportedly pending regulatory notifications, the company plans to add &ldquo;secure, segregated hot wallets&rdquo; and scheduled withdrawals to increase flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notably, today&rsquo;s post suggests that Coinbase is planning to enable its new institutional clients to &ldquo;to participate in the crypto ecosystem through&nbsp;proof of stake&nbsp;and distributed governance,&rdquo; although further details of these plans are not outlined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase Custody is the first to launch out of a suite of new products&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;by Coinbase in May, which it has said could &ldquo;unlock $10 billion of institutional investor money sitting on the sideline.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase is&nbsp; attempting to become a fully SEC-regulated broker dealer itself via its recent&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;of a financial services firm, as well as hoping to have&nbsp;its own&nbsp;federal banking license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In mid-June, Coinbase&rsquo;s Index Fund&nbsp;opened&nbsp;to large-scale, U.S. resident &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; investors, for investments of between $250,000 and $20 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coinbase has also recently&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;plans to widen its user base to the Japanese crypto market which is a huge one.</p>\r\n",

  "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;Finland bank&nbsp;released a paper on June 21 titled &ldquo;The Great Illusion of Cryptocurrencies,&rdquo; explaining why they think the concept of a digital currency is a &ldquo;fallacy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The paper, written by Aleksi Grym, Adviser on Digitalization and Head of the Digital Central Bank process in the Financial Stability and Statistics Department. It aims to explain how cryptocurrencies&rsquo; fundamental nature &ldquo;shows how poorly understood the concept of money itself still is today&rdquo; and how the Internet and social media have &ldquo;muddled our sense of fact and fiction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Grym&rsquo;s words, cryptocurrencies are not real currencies but instead &ldquo;accounting systems for non-existent assets.&rdquo; He makes the argument that digital ledger technologies, like&nbsp;blockchain, are actually the same as other record keeping systems, but that their implementation for crypto is &ldquo;unrelated to the fundamental characteristics of money:&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;For all intents and purposes, that ledger is a centralised ledger. The fact that there are multiple synchronised copies of it, distributed across a network, is irrelevant, as each one has the same data.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The article cites several studies on&nbsp;Bitcoin&nbsp;(BTC) and cryptocurrencies with relatively negative views on crypto as either a speculative instrument or a bubble whose &ldquo;fundamental value is zero.&rdquo; Grym also discredits the idea of a central bank issued digital currency, noting that it would &ldquo;practically mean bank accounts at the central bank.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the article, the main reason&nbsp;for buying cryptocurrencies are either for criminal activities, creating a sense of community, security against &ldquo;real or imagined&rdquo; state oppression, and the thrill of trading. Grym then compares buying Bitcoin to the &ldquo;intangible value&rdquo; for some customers that buy &ldquo;toys, fashion, art, club memberships, or firearms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

  "body": "<p><span>C</span>onservative member of the British Parliament Eddie Hughes has said that the British government needs a Chief Blockchain Officer to enable social freedom, increase efficiency and rebuild societal trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a report issued today entitled &lsquo;Unlocking Blockchain,&rsquo; MP Hughes &nbsp;made a number of other recommendations including an international blockchain competition to encourage talented blockchain developers and proposed a UK blockchain developmental target described as &ldquo;a longterm aim for government departments to make a 1 percent efficiency by embracing blockchain and other associated technologies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1 percent saving would amount to &pound;8 billion or $10.5 billion and would be achieved by the chief officer overseeing the application of blockchain technology to UK public services databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe report was published by Freer, a think-tank connected with the British Tory conservative party, and suggests that businesses standing to benefit from increased adoption of blockchain technology could fund the international blockchain competition and benefit both themselves and the national economy as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also discusses what Hughes calls a &ldquo;trust deficit,&rdquo; a lack of public trust in government institutions created after the 2008 financial crisis and &ldquo;a series of serious public scandals ranging from the illegal misuse of parliamentary expense accounts to claims of harassment and abuse against charity workers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After a never-ending litany of betrayals of trust and instances of overreach, the political and financial establishments, companies, and voluntary organisations that were once seen as pillars of the community, are often now held in little more than near contempt by citizens&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hughes identifies DLT and blockchain technology as a way in which the government can increase transparency in government institutions and grow public faith and trust once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Blockchain provides traceability and clear provenance. The blockchain holds all of the data from the start of the transaction, so the full history of any asset that is on the ledger can be known. There is no need to audit vast amounts of data, as the blockchain itself is the audit trail.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fintech</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hughes goes on to discuss the other applications of blockchain technology, stating that the retail industry had explored and positively identified the capacity to greatly increase operational efficiency through the automation of labor-intensive processes with 82 percent of retail professionals sharing that sentiment in a global survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nHe then cited a Santander Fintech report stating that banks could greatly reduce costs associated with cross-border payments, regulatory compliance, and securities trading through the application of DLT with a cost reduction of up to $20 billion by 2022. Sweden is predicted to save $100 million through the use of the technology in their national land registry by automating the processes involved in fraud prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also details the environmental benefits &ndash; a report from the Dubai Blochain Strategy predicts that 25.1 million economically productive hours can be reallocated through reduced document processing times and 114 MTons of C02 emissions eliminated through reduced trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report is particularly comprehensive in drawing on multiple sources citing the social and environmental benefits of blockchain application on government systems and databases, perhaps a significant indicator in the shifting tide of opinion towards the emerging technology.</p>\r\n",

IOTA&rsquo;s Supervisory Board had not yet met, despite Popov and Ivancheglo waiting for Board of Directors&rsquo; access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The statement notes that the &ldquo;circumstances lead to a situation, where two of the IOTA founders have been &lsquo;waiting for board seats&rsquo; for more than four months,&rdquo; adding:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Unfortunately, sufficient priority was not given to this open issue, and there was a failure to keep the missing board members informed about progress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tensions simmered under the status quo, resulting in Ivancheglo demanding embattled board chairman Dominik Schiener to quit. The statement notes that &ldquo;Sergey Ivancheglo has since stated that asking for Dominik to resign was an emotional reaction to the situation, which had built up over months. The situation did not feel fair to him, being an integral member of the team behind IOTA as we know it today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The MoU should be in place by August 10, an makeshift&nbsp;ahead of the Supervisory Board&rsquo;s first meeting in September, IOTA&rsquo;s latest statement reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the Foundation and Schiener have faced criticism over the past year. earlier this year in april,&nbsp;a&nbsp;scandal&nbsp;broke out after Schiener told an independent security researcher that she &ldquo;needed a slap.
